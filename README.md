# Simon Says!

## A Visual Memory Game - Milestone 2 Project by Mikael Lindberg

The inspiration for this project comes from a electronic console of a childrens toy called Simon. I loved playing it and spent hours trying to outperform my last attempt.
Sadly it broke after a few years and was never replaced. Through the years I have on many occasions had fond flashbacks from my times playing the game. 
When the MS2 project was presented I instantly decided to recreate my childhood game with a few modern upgrades.

# UX

As the developer I aim for a fun and relaxing game that offers a break from the stress of everyday life. The concept is easy; 
Follow along a random generated sequence that increments itself when you get the current sequence right. If not, the game is over. 
The interface should be aesy for the user to understand.

## User Stories
- The game should offer different levels of difficulty depending on age/preference of the player 
- It should be able to compete with friends in pairs.
- A highscore function that saves the scores of top 5-10 players

(Interviewed my daughter, 9 years old)

# Features
A single webpage, with three distinct sections, a header for the "logo", the main playing section and a footer at the bottom.

- Colored boxes as playing "buttons".
- A couple of <buttons> for different features of the game, start/pause, reset, difficulties
    the buttons use javascript to change the layout of the webpage.
- A score function of current player's accomplished level.

## Features in upcoming releases

- Different levels of difficulty depending on age/preference of the player 
- Function to compete with friends in pairs.
- Highscore function that saves the scores of top 5-10 players
